WF Project 2022

Banking App using MEAN stack & passport.js.

DB Connection string needs to be added to ".env" in root with the following content:
DBConnect="URL"

e.g: 
DBCOnnect="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.x5v4coo.mongodb.net/bankAppDB"

This is done so that connection string isn't made public on the github repo.
